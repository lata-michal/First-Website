# First Website

This repository hosts an educational project I developed during my university course on web development. The project started as an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and evolved to incorporate more advanced technologies, including PHP, MySQL, AJAX, XML and XSL.

## Live Site

The website is hosted on DigitalOcean and is available [here.](https://seashell-app-6cbyv.ondigitalocean.app/)

## Deployment

The project is set up with continuous deployment through GitHub. Every new commit pushed to the main branch automatically triggers a deployment on DigitalOcean, ensuring that the live site remains up to date with the latest changes.

## Features and Technologies

This project showcases a range of web development skills and concepts learned throughout the course, including:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL

## About the Course

This project served as the capstone for my university course on building websites. It demonstrates my ability to combine various web technologies to create dynamic, interactive, and efficient web applications. The course covered both client-side and server-side development, providing a solid foundation in modern web development practices.
