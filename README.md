# First Website

This repository hosts an educational project for my university courses. The project serves as an introduction to web development, with an initial focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, it will evolve to include additional technologies like PHP, SQL, and others as we progress through the curriculum.

## Live Site

The website is hosted on DigitalOcean and is available at: [https://seashell-app-32qag.ondigitalocean.app/](https://seashell-app-32qag.ondigitalocean.app/).

## Deployment

The project is set up with continuous deployment through GitHub. Every new commit pushed to the main branch will automatically trigger a deployment on DigitalOcean, ensuring that the live site is always up to date with the latest changes.

This project will be continuously developed and refined to demonstrate a range of web development skills and concepts introduced throughout the course.
